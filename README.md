/* Description: A customer wants the shortest path to all the stadium in California.
 * They want to know the number of stadiums and distance they will travel.
 * Tasks: Implement algorithm to find order of stadiums with the least amount of distance travelled.
 *        Implement algorith to record the distance travelled for the
 *        order of stadiums with least amount of distance.
 *        Print out the order of stadium travelled and the distance in between them.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios: 
 *        Test if algorithm gives the shortest path to all stadiums.
 *        See if algorithm provides distance travelled of shortest path.
 *        See if algorithm prints order of stadiums and distance travelled for shortest path.
