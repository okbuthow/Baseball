/* Description: A customer wants the shortest path to all the stadium in California.
 * They want to know the number of stadiums and distance they will travel.
 * Tasks: Implement algorithm to find order of stadiums with the least amount of distance travelled.
 *        Implement algorith to record the distance travelled for the
 *        order of stadiums with least amount of distance.
 *        Print out the order of stadium travelled and the distance in between them.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios: 
 *        Test if algorithm gives the shortest path to all stadiums.
 *        See if algorithm provides distance travelled of shortest path.
 *        See if algorithm prints order of stadiums and distance travelled for shortest path.

 /* Description: A customer wants the shortest trip to all the stadiums starting
 * from the stadium in California as well as the distance it requires.
 * 
 * Tasks: 
 * Create an algorithm that provides the route to all stadiums from the one with 
 * California that has the least distance.
 * Create an algorithm that calculates the distance of the least-distance route 
 * from the stadium in California to all the rest.
 * 
 * Test Scenarios: 
 * Test if the distance of the least-distance route provided by algorithm is really
 * the least.
 * Test if the distance of the least-distance route provided by algorithm is calculated
 * correctly and is printed.
 * See if the least-distance route provided by algorithm is printed.

 /* Description: An administrator needs to add in a new team to the system. 
 * Tasks:  Create an algorithm that creates the details of a new team into the system.
 *         Have the System set up so that it can easily input similar data to that of
 *          the older team.
 * Test Scenarios: 
 *          Test whether the algorithm is able to input all needed data for new team into
 *          the system.
